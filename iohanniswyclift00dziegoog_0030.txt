receive that sacrament. Money may be given lor Masses, but merely
that the priest may have food to eat. Fines imposed as penance at ab·
solution from excommunication should be regarded as mere punishments,
and in n0 wise as the price of absolution. Custom is here ol no value
against Divine law; il money is given for the consecration os a bishop,
sorau abbot’s instalment‚ dre, it is simony. If only at such ceremonies,
as a customary see, it is not indeed simony; but great care sould be
taken to avoid the very appearance ol simony or ol greed in such
casce. A candidate sor a bishopric has not the right to appease an
unjust opponent either by money or by a promise ol money, when he
has become a Bishop, however, he may without sin take steps to get
rid os persecution. Money may be given lor the sustenance of the clergy,
hut there must be no intention either to buy or to sell spiritual services;
and is money be withheld, the priest must take care to render his ser·
vices as before. No one is allowed to receive anything (except as a
free gift) on the occasion ol admission into a monastery. lt is forbidden
to sell the consecrated vessels, so long as they retain their lorm; in
cases ol necessity, they must first be broken. A Bishop may, without
simony and for pious uses, take certain lirst-fruits from a benefice before
it is conferred; but to order the beneficiary to give the first-fruita would
be simony. Simoniacs should be deprived ol their livings; priests whose
ordination is infected with simony receive the sacerdotal powerS, but
not the right nor the grace to exercise them. lt is not allowed to
receive Holy Orders from a bishop promoted by simony, even il this
is only known certainly, without any legal prool. Asimoniacal priest

must not only give back his living. hut all he has got or might have

got by it; unless he was unaware of the fact (if. τ’. g. a third person
committed simony lor him without his knowledge). Monks received into
a convent by simony must leave it; the Pope alone can, in some cases,
dispense with these penalties3 in others, the bishop has the power
to do so·

This short summary of the more important points in the question
De Simonia may be suflicient to show that the Church, in principle at
least, and concerning simony in the contracted meaning given to it, is
hardly less severe than Wyclif. But Wyclif, as already remarked‚ takes
the widest possible view ol things. According to him, as we may see
by a comparison with the sust pages ol De Aymslusia and De Blasplremia,
