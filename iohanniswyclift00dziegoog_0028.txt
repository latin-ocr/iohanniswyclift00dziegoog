simoniacally obtained any benefice, we are bound to do penance for the
past, and strive in the present and for the future to make amends,
leaving the superfluity of our income to the poor; if unfit for the office,
we must resign it. We may desire the work of a bishop, but not his
dignity, nor any sinecures or pluralities; nor may we go to Rome to get
benefices· — As for simony being an act, not a desire, it is either one
or both, according to the School; the main point is the inordination of
the will. And as this will implies wrongmindedness, simony is heresy by
implication; and it becomes explicitly s0, when an unlawful bargain is
defended. 'l‘he chapter closes with observations on the difficulty of
putting down simony (pp. 14-27).

This is perhaps one of the most important chapters in the whole

work; for, by Wyclif's answer to the objections propounded, we clearly

see how and in what his definition differs from the usual one given by
theologians. And as it is interesting to learn what the regular doctrine
is, Ι may here give a short abstract of it, following St. Thomas (Sum.
Th. 2a 2³⁰, qu. 100) as the most trustworthy of Roman Catholic divines.
We shall see that both Aquinas and Wyclif agree as to the heinous
character of the sin dealt with, and the absolute necessity of putting it
down, even by the strongest measureS. But, when it comes to the
question: What is simony? Wyclif, by the force of his definition, goes
a great deal farther than Aquinas or than the Decretals; yet he quotes
them all along as if they applied to simony understood in his sense, not
in theirs. As his definition overlaps the other, it very frequently happens
that his application is right, but not always. By the by, it is curious to
note with what evident respect he sets aside the opinion of that Holy
Doctor (a sancto doctore, p. 14). Possibly it is because, like himself,
though not to the same extent, St. 'l‘homas was a Realist; for Wyclil
was a philosopher above all, and his whole theological system is but
the logical outcome of his philosophy. But, as a fact, St. 'l‘homas is
very often in most decided opposition to him: for instance, asto Wyclif’s
doctrine that a bad priest is a priest no longer. St. 'l'homas decides
that an immoral and heretical priest, even after degradation‚ has the
power of saying Mass (pars 111³, qu. LXXXlll; that wicked priestS, if
they possess proper jurisdiction, can give absolutions that are valid, and
that schismatics and heretics only fail to do so, because deprived of that
jurisdiction (qu XlX, Suppl. Sum. Th). ,tlnd here l am tempted‚ hy the
