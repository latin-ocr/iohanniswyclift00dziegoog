XII lNTRODUCTlON.

necting link between them and Ιι. The readings ol a b c de f g very
often agree in contradicting lt and i, and there can be no doubt that
these seven MSS. were copied from the very same source. There are
many proofs of this; but it will suffice here to select one of the most
striking, on p. 81, l. 24, 25. The words from fructum to ministerio
are absent from a b c e s g, and have been suppliedby another hand
in d. This agreement is certainly not accidental,¹ and can be accountcd
for only by the supposition of a common source. This original (Z), there-
fore, stands in the same sisterly relation to i as Y to the source of l.

But a b c d e fg do not all proceed from Z in the same way.

Ithink that only b, d (before correction) and s were copied directly

from Ζ; and even for these, the hypothesis of intermediate copies might
be allowed, on account of a nearer relationship between b and f,
and a closer agreement of d with h and i. At all events the resemblance
between c and e on the one hand, and a (before correction) and gon
the other, is strikingly close, and extends even to the spelling. 'l‘his fol-
lows from the variants in the suot-notes, and would appear with still
greater evidence, were it not for the difficulties mentioned at the outset.
These prevented, not only a careful selection of the variants of c ande
(partly, t00, off), but also a proper correction of the proofsheets.
The relationship of a with g may also be demonstrated by a proof extrinsic
to the text: the index of catchwords, which (as I have carefully ascer-
tained) belongs to these MSS. alone. A close examination has shown me the
impossibility of α and c being copied from g and ε,- or nice versa. We can
only frame a third hypothesis, viz., that α andg are copies of another MS.
(A) and that c and e proceed again from another (Β). So that A arrd B,
which have not come down to us, stand in the same relation to Z as b,
d, and f. The transmission of the nine MSS. may, therefore, be set
forth in the following diagram:
