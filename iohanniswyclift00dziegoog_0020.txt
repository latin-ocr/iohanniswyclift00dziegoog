Church ol Rome anrl in the Greek Church, not to speak ol other com· '
munities separated lrom them by still wider differences, that it is impos· .
sible to explain the words by a metaphor, and that Christ's Body and
Blood are really present in the Eucharist. Such being the lact, Ι think
it may be interesting to enquire 1) Whether the doctrine os Transub·
stantiation was anything more than a denial oi any explanation tending
to deny the reality ol Christ’s presence in the Sacrament; 2) Whether
Wyclil went larther than denying the doctrine ol ‘accidens sine subjecto',
upheld by the Schoolmen ol his day; and 3) How far his explanation
ol Christ's real presence was unjustly, and how sar justly‚ condemned
by the Church from its own point of victv.

1. What is Reality, in the ordinary sense ol the term? What is
the difference between a real orange and a painted one, or a wax
orange, or the result ol mere hallucination? Evidently a painted orange,
however well painted, only deceives the sight, answering only to one of
the tests of reality. An artificial orange may deceive the touch too, and
il suitably perlumed, the sense ol smell; but the sense ol taste will soon
convince us that the object we see, touch and smell is not real — as
an orange. But suppose we are so hallucinated in all our senses, as to
sce, leel, smell and taste an imaginary orange; either we should srnd

that the hallucination did not last long, or il it did, we should no longer
be in a state' to reason about it. lt is, therefore, the answer to all the

sensible tests ol reality, given in a permanent and coherent manner, that
constitutes sensible reality as we conceive it: it is upon the objective
value ol these tests, taken together, that all natural science is founded.
And in this sense no Roman Catholic can deny — or at least, the doc-
trine os Transubstantiation does not deny — that the Eucharistic bread
really remains alter consecration, and that Christ's Budy is not really
present. Every possible test ol the sensible reality ol bread is answered
without the slightest ambiguity. St. Thomas, Ι need not say, admits this
in his ‘Summa Theologica’; he asserts that the elements nourish‚ and
that the sacramental wine, il taken in excess, would intoxicate: which is
merely a doctrine ol common sense. ll'ollrirrg ol the reality, so lar as
the senses gu, is changed by the sacramental words.

But then, how can this bread be Christ's Body really, if it is really

only bread? Bearing in mind the hypothesis which excludes a mere empty
metaphor, there is but one answer. We must believe in another sort ol
