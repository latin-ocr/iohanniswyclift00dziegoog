VIII lNTRODUCTlON.

The margins are wide, with a lew words in smaller letters written upon
them here and there. Only one column to each page.

De Simonis extends from f. 83 to f. 128, with blank spaces wher-
ever the copyist could not make out a word. The chapters have no
subdivisions. The Argumentum is placed at the beginning; the ‘verses
‘Explicit . . . prelatis’‚ form the conclusion. The ‘Conclusio' (ff.127‘- 128)
does not belong to De Siirtonin.

3. Cod. Vindob. 4504 (c). Described by me for ΜΓ. Harris: See
De Benedicta Incarnutione, Introduction, p. XII. Ι subjoin a fuller de-
scription of what especially concerns De Simonis. This tractate extends
from-l. 1 to f. 36. No title. A few corrections, both on the margin and
in the text. 'l'he remark that De Compositione Hominis is non examinatus
can by no¹ means be taken as a prool that the other MSS. are examinati.
De Simonis is also uot properly corrected. Gaps have been left unsilled
in the places oi illegible words, and many absurd blunders have been
allowed to remain. Writing ol the first decade of the xV1¹¹ century. Spaces
are left sor initial letters to be filled in. The Argumentum is at the
beginning of the book. No subdivisions oi chapters. Instead of the lines:
“Explicit-prelatos”, there is “Explicit tractatus de Symonia³’.

4. Cod. Vindob. 4515 (d). Shortly described in the Dialogus, lntro-
duction‚ p. XXlll; very fully in Buddensieg’s I’olcmicul Works of Wyclif
pp. XLVI—XLVIII.

De Simonia (ff. 27—67'). No title. Several hands, all belonging to
the first decades of the XVth century. Many glaring blunders in the MS.
as first copied, are corrected by numerous marginal or supralinear notes;

here and there the original mistake has been erased, and the correct
text supplied. This of course considerably alters its value; a point
to which we shall subsequently allude. 'l‘here are a few catchwords.
'l‘he chapters have no subdivisions but are indicated by red initials
The Argumentum stands lirst, and the lines “Explicit”, &c are
wanting.
5. Cod. Vindob. 3927 ( ).
' Described by Buddensicg, Pol. Works os W. Ι. Vol. XLlll.

’ De Simonis (ff. 53-74‘) has, besides the pagination that obtains
all through the work, a special pagination of its own. Each of the two
pages which face each other in the open hook bear the same number,
and the lour columns making up the two pages are lettered a, b, c and d
